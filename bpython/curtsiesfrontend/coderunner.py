    Running code requests a refresh by calling
    request_from_main_context(force_refresh=True), which
    suspends execution of the code by blocking on a queue
    that the main thread was blocked on.

    After load_code() is called with the source code to be run,
    the run_code() method should be called to start running the code.
    The running code may request screen refreshes and user input
    by calling request_from_main_context.
    When this are called, the running source code cedes
    control, and the current run_code() method call returns.

    The return value of run_code() determines whether the method ought
    to be called again to complete execution of the source code.

    Once the screen refresh has occurred or the requested user input
    has been gathered, run_code() should be called again, passing in any
    requested user input. This continues until run_code returns Done.

    The code thread is responsible for telling the main thread
    what it wants returned in the next run_code call - CodeRunner
    just passes whatever is passed in to run_code(for_code) to the
    code thread.
